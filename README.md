INFO

The project work was done solo in 2019 Autumn in TAMK, Tampere University of Applied sciences during
our first programming course.

We were asked to do a Tic Tac Toe -game with Java, where you play against AI, and you can determine the
size of the map when you start the game.

I was enthusiastic about making a good AI that can beat the player on my own without trying to implement
someone else's algorithm, and I'm very satisfied how it turned out in the end.

The game uses ascii graphics.

I haven't touched the code after december 2019 and I would have done lots of things very different if a
similar exercise was given for me today.
